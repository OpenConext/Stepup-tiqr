that uses the url specifier 'piggyauth', then that's what you'd configure here.
It ties the identity provider to the mobile apps.

The challenge response algorithm to use for authentication. Must be a valid OCRA suite value (see the OCRA spec).

counter or time inputs. If you're confused by this setting, you can leave it to the default,
which results in the system using 10-digit hexadecimal challenges, a 6 digit numeric response,
and SHA1 as the hashing algorithm (OCRA-1:HOTP-SHA1-6:QH10-S).

Set this to 'dummy' if you do want push notifications but do not want to use a token exchange
(not recommended).

Tiqr must store user secrets and other details for a user.
By default this setting is set to 'file' which stores the data in
JSON files in the specifified directory. While this is great for testing purposes,
we recommend you implement your own user storage (e.g. your existing user database or an LDAP server).
To do this, have a look at the userstorage subdirectory in the authTiqr directory.
