Feature: When an user needs to register for a new token
  To register an user for a new token
  As a service provider
  I need to send an AuthnRequest to the identity provider

  Background:
    Given I clear the logs

  Scenario: When an user needs to register for a new token
    Given I am on "/demo/sp"
    When I press "Register user"
    Then I should see "Register new Tiqr account"
    And I should be on "/registration"

    Then I scan the tiqr registration qrcode
    And the user registers the service with notification type "APNS" address: "0000000000111111111122222222223333333333"
    Then we have a registered user

    When I am on "/registration"
    Then I should see "Javascript is disabled, please click the button below to proceed"
    Then I press "Submit"

    Then I should see "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success"

    And the logs are:
