Feature: When an user needs to register for a new token
  To register an user for a new token
  As a service provider
  I need to send an AuthnRequest to the identity provider

  Background:
    Given I clear the logs

  Scenario: When an user needs to register for a new token
    Given I am on "/demo/sp"
    When I press "Register user"
    Then I should see "Register new Tiqr account"
    And I should be on "/registration"

    Then I scan the tiqr registration qrcode
    And the user registers the service with notification type "APNS" address: "0000000000111111111122222222223333333333"
    Then we have a registered user

    When I am on "/registration"
    Then I should see "Javascript is disabled, please click the button below to proceed"
    Then I press "Submit"

    Then I should see "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success"
    And I should see the trusted device cookie for address "0000000000111111111122222222223333333333"

    And the logs are:

  Scenario: When an user needs to register for a new token but is unable to scan the QR code
    Given I am on "/demo/sp"
    When I press "Register user"
    Then I should see "Register new Tiqr account"
    And I should be on "/registration"

    Then I click the tiqr registration qrcode
    And the user registers the service with notification type "APNS" address: "0000000000111111111122222222223333333333"
    Then we have a registered user

    When I am on "/registration"
    Then I should see "Javascript is disabled, please click the button below to proceed"
    Then I press "Submit"

    Then I should see "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success"

    And the logs are:

  Scenario: When an user needs to cancel the registration
    Given I am on "/demo/sp"

    # Tiqr page with QR code.
    When I press "Register user"
    Then I should see "Register new Tiqr account"
    And I should be on "/registration"
    Then I follow "Cancel"

    # GSSP return endpoint.
    And I should see "Javascript is disabled, please click the button below to proceed"
    And I press "Submit"

    # Service prodvider
    Then I should see "Cannot process response, preconditions not met: \"Responder/AuthnFailed User cancelled the request\""

    And the logs are:

#  Scenario: When the user is redirected from an unknown service provider he should see an error page
#    Given a normal SAML 2.0 AuthnRequest form a unknown service provider
#    Then the response status code should be 406
#    And I should see "Error - Unknown service provider"
#    And the logs are:
#      | level  | message                 | sari |
#      | notice | Received sso request    |      |
#      | info   | Processing AuthnRequest |      |

#  Scenario: When an user request the sso endpoint without AuthnRequest the request should be denied
#    When I am on "/saml/sso"
#    Then the response status code should be 406
#    And I should see "Something went wrong. Please try again."
#    And the logs are:
#      | level  | message                 | sari |
