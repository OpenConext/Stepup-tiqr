Feature: When an user needs to authenticate
  As a service provider
  I need to send an AuthnRequest with a nameID to the identity provider

  Background:
    Given the registration QR code is scanned
    When the user registers the service
    Then we have a registered user
    And I clear the logs

  Scenario: When an user needs to authenticate
    # Service provider demo page
    Given I am on "/demo/sp"
    And I fill in "Subject name id" with my identifier
    When I press "Authenticate user"

    # Tiqr authentication page with qr code
    Then I should see "Log in with tiqr"
    And I should be on "/authentication"

    # The app
    Then I scan the tiqr authentication qrcode
    And the app authenticates to the service
    Then we have a authenticated app

    # Refresh tiqr page to see get redirection
    And I am on "/authentication"

    # GSSP sso-return endpoint to return to the service provider
    And I should see "Javascript is disabled, please click the button below to proceed"
    And I press "Submit"

    # Service provider AuthNRequest response page
    Then I should see "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success"

    And the logs are:
